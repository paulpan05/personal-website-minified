export const AboutMe = (
  <p>
    I currently live in the Greater Boston area, and I am working as a software
    engineer at Meta&apos;s Reality Labs. I am experienced with building and
    debugging iOS and Android applications at work (including Android system
    apps). I have also developed full-stack web applications with Node.js,
    React, and Next.js. One of the projects I am doing outside of work is a
    hardware-agnostic parallel computing library written in C++, Objective-C,
    and CUDA, as I am interested in HPC research.

    This website is developed with Next.js. The production website&apos;s server
    is running as a systemd service on an Oracle Cloud Instance. The systemd
    service is backed by a Nginx reverse proxy, which directs traffic to the
    Next.js server if the domain name matches panpaul.com
